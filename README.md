# Conceptual Modeling of Systems – Athens City Center

The project aims to create an online guide for urban areas with recreational, touristic, naturalistic, and cultural attractions. It includes an OWL-RDF schema and a report including problem formulation, information, graphs and queries.

Our goal is to document, map (e.g., on Google Maps), describe, and link all points of interest in the designated area, including buildings, monuments, archaeological sites, artwork, flora, fauna, art installations, and public transport. Each entity within these categories is cataloged with its name, relevant information (varies by category), geographical coordinates, website references (if available), and additional pertinent details. For instance, we provide species and origin details for plants in the National Garden and historical context for artworks within the garden. The schema features a few instances for demonstration purposes.

The model is based on the CIDOC CRM version 7.1. (http://www.cidoc-crm.org/) and developed using Protégé (https://protege.stanford.edu/). We used Research Space (https://researchspace.org/) to run the queries and generate the graphs presented in the report.
